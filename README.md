Electrum-server for the Electrum client
=========================================

  * Author: thomasv@asiccointalk
  * Language: Python

Features
--------

  * The server uses a asiccoind and a leveldb backend.
  * The server code is open source. Anyone can run a server, removing single
    points of failure concerns.
  * The server knows which set of AsicCoin addresses belong to the same wallet,
    which might raise concerns about anonymity. However, it should be possible
    to write clients capable of using several servers.

Installation
------------

  1. To install and run a pruning server (easiest setup) see README.leveldb
  2. Install [jsonrpclib](https://github.com/joshmarshall/jsonrpclib).
  3. Launch the server: `nohup python -u server.py > /var/log/electrum.log &`
     or use the included `start` script.

See the included `HOWTO.md` for greater detail on the installation process.
